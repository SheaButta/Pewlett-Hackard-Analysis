# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
A company named Pewlett Hackard (PH) has hired a new data scientist (Bobby) to perform some data analysis in their database department.  After a few months of working with Bobby, I was able to prove that SQL is an awesome data analysis tool and they are on board utilizing SQL to perform data analysis.  PH is expecting a "silver tsunami" as many of their current employees reach retirement age.  A PH manager has delivered a few datasets for analysis and would like us to; (1) Determine the number of retiring employees per title and (2) Identify employees who are eligible to participate in the mentorship program.  We will summarize the analysis to help the PH manager prepare for this retirement tsunami.

The standard data analysis principles were used which includes; (1) Determine the number of rows and columns; (2) Data types used; and (3) Is the data readable?

PH expects the following deliverables:

- The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
- The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
